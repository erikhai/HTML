Hi, my name is Erik Hai and I am studying Bachelors of Software Enginering (Honours) at the
University Of Sydney. In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, reading manga and playing chess. I
also enjoy creating various coding projects. When creating projects, I ensure that they are 
relevant for my day to day life or I feel that my work will be benefical towards the 
community. I try to create various projects ranging from banking system replicas to website design
to train a machine learning model.

Throughout my time in University, I've had the opportunity to explore various programming languages
and engineering concepts, enriching my understanding of the software industry. In addition to expanding
my technical knowledge, I've also developed essential leadership skills through project collaborations
and team engagements. Recognizing the value of effective time management, I've learned to prioritize tasks
and optimize productivity amidst academic and extracurricular commitments. Furthermore, my communication
abilities have evolved, enabling clearer articulation of ideas and fostering better collaboration with peers.
These experiences have collectively contributed to my holistic growth as a student and future professional
in the field of software engineering.

I currently work as an Event Manager for the USYD's cyber security society. I wish to help 
introduce people into this field whilst also enhancing my own understanding of it. As an Event 
Manager, I help plan out how the events will work, prepare necessary materials for it and ensure
it is applicable to everyone. I really enjoy helping out the community and it makes me glad when 
the community achieves something from my efforts. Feel free to look around this website at my 
experience and projects and come say hi to me if you like what you see. <span class = "wave">üëã</span> <span class = "opposite-wave">üëã</span>
