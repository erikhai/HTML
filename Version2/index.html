Hi, my name is Erik Hai and I am studying Bachelors of Software Enginering (Honours) at the
University Of Sydney. In my spare time, I enjoy drawing, reading manga, playing chess and
also enjoy creating various coding projects. 

Throughout my time in University, I've had the opportunity to explore various programming languages
and engineering concepts and developing a solid understanding of the software industry. In addition to expanding
my technical knowledge, I've also developed essential leadership and transferable skills through project collaborations
and team engagements. Recognizing the value of effective time management, I've learned to prioritize tasks
and optimize productivity amidst academic and extracurricular commitments. Furthermore, my communication
abilities have also improved, enabling clearer articulation of ideas and fostering better collaboration with peers.
These experiences have collectively contributed to my growth as a student and as an engineer.

I currently work as an Event Manager for the USYD's cyber security society. I wish to help 
introduce people into this field whilst also enhancing my own understanding of it. As an Event 
Manager, I help plan out how the events will work, prepare necessary materials for it and ensure
it is applicable to everyone. I really enjoy helping out the community and it makes me glad when 
the community achieves something from my efforts. 

Feel free to look around this website at my experience and projects and come say hi to me if you like what you see.
