# My Portfolio

This project is about my progress regarding my portfolio creation. To enhance my HTML, CSS skills, I have decided to create my own personal website. In version 1, I have been playing around with
concepts and testing ideas. Version 2 is the actual deployment of my website and will be the "First Version of it"

## Future Plans for this portfolio
1. I wish to learn react and use those skills into my website
2. I also want to learn Node.js and Three.js and incoperate 3D objects/elements into my website to give it a more unique feel
